## ðŸš² Demand Forecasting for Seoul's Bicycle-Sharing System

This project was developed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It applies real-world data analysis techniques to understand and forecast bicycle rental demand in Seoul, South Korea.

Using R, APIs, and machine learning, this end-to-end solution includes:

- **Data collection** via web scraping and OpenWeather API
- **Data cleaning** and feature engineering with tidyverse
- **Exploratory data analysis** and visual storytelling
- **Predictive modeling** using regularized regression (`glmnet`)
- **Interactive dashboard** deployment using R Shiny

The goal is to simulate a real business scenario where a city planner or transportation company could use the dashboard to monitor and anticipate demand, improving service efficiency.
